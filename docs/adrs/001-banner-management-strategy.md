# ADR-001: Banner Management and Display Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

The Naebak platform requires a flexible and efficient banner management system to display promotional content, announcements, and informational banners across different sections of the website. We needed to decide on the architecture for banner positioning, categorization, targeting, and performance tracking. Several approaches were considered, including a simple static banner system, a complex rule-based system, and a hybrid approach with smart recommendations.

**Decision:**

We have decided to implement a comprehensive banner management system with the following key components:

## **Banner Classification System:**

*   **Banner Types**: Different visual formats (hero, sidebar, footer, popup) with specific dimensions and display characteristics.
*   **Positions**: Predefined locations on the website where banners can be displayed (top, sidebar_left, sidebar_right, footer, etc.).
*   **Categories**: Content-based classification (informational, promotional, service, emergency) for filtering and targeting.

## **Smart Display Logic:**

*   **Priority-Based Ordering**: Banners are assigned priority levels (1-5) to control display order within the same position.
*   **Geographic Targeting**: Optional governorate-specific targeting for localized content.
*   **Time-Based Scheduling**: Start and end dates for campaign management and automatic expiry.
*   **Status Management**: Draft, active, paused, and expired states for lifecycle management.

## **Analytics and Optimization:**

*   **Click Tracking**: Comprehensive click event recording with metadata (user agent, IP, referrer).
*   **View Counting**: Impression tracking for performance analysis.
*   **Recommendation Engine**: Simple algorithm considering priority, popularity, and user context.

## **Technical Implementation:**

*   **Image Processing**: Automatic optimization and thumbnail generation for different display contexts.
*   **File Management**: Secure upload handling with validation and size limits.
*   **API-First Design**: RESTful endpoints for all banner operations to support multiple frontend applications.

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**

*   **Flexibility**: The system can handle various banner types and display scenarios without code changes.
*   **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive analytics enable data-driven optimization of banner campaigns.
*   **Geographic Targeting**: Supports localized content delivery for different governorates.
*   **Automated Management**: Time-based scheduling reduces manual intervention for campaign management.
*   **Scalability**: The API-first design allows easy integration with multiple frontend applications.

**Negative:**

*   **Complexity**: The comprehensive feature set requires more development and maintenance effort compared to a simple static system.
*   **Performance Considerations**: Analytics tracking and recommendation calculations may impact response times if not properly optimized.
*   **Storage Requirements**: Image processing and thumbnail generation increase storage needs.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The recommendation algorithm is intentionally simple in the initial implementation and can be enhanced with machine learning capabilities in future iterations.
*   Image processing is handled synchronously during upload, which may need to be moved to background processing for larger files.
*   The system is designed to be stateless to support horizontal scaling as traffic grows.
